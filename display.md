# Display

The [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/display) CSS property sets whether an element 
is treated as a block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.

```css
display: block;
display: inline-block;
display: none;
display: flex;
display: grid;
```
